# üöÄ Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This is a web application that predicts customer churn for a bank using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The app also provides explanations for its predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Single Prediction**: Input a single customer's details through a user-friendly form to get an instant churn prediction.
- **Batch Prediction**: Upload a CSV file with multiple customers to get predictions for all of them at once.
- **Prediction Explanation**: For single predictions, a SHAP force plot visualizes which features contributed most to the prediction, making the model's decision transparent.
- **Improved UI**: A clean, tabbed interface built with Streamlit and styled with custom CSS.
